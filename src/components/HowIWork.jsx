      <p>
        I believe in shipping fast, refactoring often, and learning always. I'm
        adaptable, proactive, and collaborative â€” unafraid to lead when needed,
        always ready to pitch in where it counts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether flying solo or working cross-functionally, I rely on clean code,
        strong fundamentals, and a constant drive to improve.
